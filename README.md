### Hi there and thanks for passing by! ðŸ“¸

My name is Carolina, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer, graduated from ISDI Coders in Madrid.

After more than 12 years working in the Hospitality industry, I decided to leave my comfort zone and make a big change in life with something I had always been curious about: programming.
I also studied Law and I am passionate about photography!

I am a truly Team Worker, resilient, love learning and adquiring new knowledge!
